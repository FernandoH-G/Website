    "meet_me": "My name is Fernando Herrera-Gomez. I was born in Fresno, CA. My folks moved a lot to follow their seasonal work. Eventually we settled in Bakersfield CA. Going into California State University Bakersfield, I had it as my goal to eventually become a lawyer. In order to fulfill this goal, I studied and eventually graduated with a degree in Philosophy from CSUB. I met good classmates and even better professors. One classmate turned me on to a UCLA Law Fellows program where I applied to and eventually was a part of and a professor helped me land an internship in a law firm in Bakersfield. Attending this internship was a pivotal part of my life. After some time with the internship, I started to have doubts as to my motivation to become a lawyer. After much introspection, I decided to no longer pursue a career in Law. Cut to 2016, I saw myself attending CSUB once more, but this time, as a computer science student! I knew that after my first year, programming was what I wanted to devote my life to.",
